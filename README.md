# Coming Soon Page
## Purpose
The purpose of this page is to show the user in what time will the webpage be ready. This is shown by the countdown on the page.
## User personas
The target users are clearly stated on the page.
## User stories (features)
Since it is just a Coming Soon page, there is nothing for the user to interact with or do.
## Website structure
There is only one page
## Page descriptions
This page mainly consists of three points:
1. The logo of the webpage
1. A saying/statement of the company, explaining either it's views or it's purpose
1. A countdown showing the user the exact time it will be released
## Non-functional requirements
* The page should automatically change it's proportions depending on what device the user is currently using (f.e pc or mobile device)
